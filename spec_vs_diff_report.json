  "summary": "The diff implements nearly all required features across backend and frontend. All 9 requirements are substantially addressed. Minor gaps exist around the 'getPost' function visibility in the backend summary, the constraint against altering existing data models (Lead/Service CRUD are now stubbed/broken in useQueries.ts), and a few AC details.",

      "requirement": "Backend actor must expose 'getPost' function as part of REQ-1 CRUD operations",
      "reason": "The diff shows createPost, getAllPosts, updatePost, deletePost in the backend but getPost is not confirmed visible in the truncated backend/main.mo diff. The file summary does not explicitly mention getPost being exposed as a public query function.",

      "requirement": "Do not alter existing data models (Lead, Service) or their CRUD functions — constraint violation",
      "reason": "The useQueries.ts file stubs out all Lead and Service CRUD hooks to throw errors, and LeadsPage/ServiceManagementPage/ServicesCatalogPage import Lead/Service types from useQueries rather than backend. The existing CRUD functions appear to be broken/removed from the backend rather than preserved. The constraint explicitly states 'Do not alter existing data models (Lead, Service) or their CRUD functions'.",
