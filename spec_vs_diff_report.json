  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented in the diff. AutomationDashboardPage.tsx sets all automation flags to true by default with localStorage persistence, and seedServices.ts is expanded from 35 to 58 services with 23 new services added. However, REQ-1 specifies using automationConfig.ts as the source of truth for flags, which the implementation does not do.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Programmatically set all automation feature flags defined in automationConfig.ts to true on page load if they are not already active.",
      "reason": "The implementation in AutomationDashboardPage.tsx defines its own local AutomationConfig interface and defaultConfig object rather than importing and using flags from automationConfig.ts as the requirement explicitly specifies. No import of automationConfig.ts is visible in the diff.",
