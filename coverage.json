(2) A priority queue panel that lists tasks ranked by deadline and dependency — tasks can be marked complete, reordered by priority (High/Medium/Low), and have a due date. (3) A task completion tracker that, when a task is marked done, auto-suggests the next logical step from the remaining queue. All task data must be persisted to localStorage.",
